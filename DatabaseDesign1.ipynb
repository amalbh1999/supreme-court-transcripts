He could get the mandatory minimum sentence, even if there were no mandatory minimum prescribed. He is exposed to a sentence of one to years.

So, if you look at it as a negligence case, then you look at the restatement, and then you look at what the court ordered below, I do have trouble with one of the things.

And the negligence that they're claiming here is taking a thing, a physical thing which the manufacturer knows is dangerous and unreasonably putting it out into interstate commerce, perhaps on a boat, perhaps somewhere else.

Now, what you said was you could end up with different applications of that in different States. Of course, every national advertiser faces that situation at the moment.

And that's a matter of Illinois law. And although the statutes don't seem to say it, they might. And the second is that this seems mixed up in my mind -- not necessarily your fault; it may be my mind -- but it seems to me there are two quite separate questions: when you are entitled to a final hearing of whether forfeiture is right or wrong; and whether you are entitled to a preliminary hearing on whether there was probable cause under the statute to obtain the car. Now, that latter question I think might be impractical in many cases to work out until there's been a trial of an individual who's accused of a crime, which may be much later. But the former question is where I think you have a point, that there are five instances here in this statute where a policeman could seize a car without a warrant and he has to have probable cause under most of them nonetheless. So your clients might say: He did not have probable cause; I want a neutral magistrate to contest it. Now, in my mind that reaches -- that's a different question than the final hearing about who's    entitled to the car. And I also see the three statutes and now I see a case where here in front of me everything is mixed up.

Suppose you just said, look, what we\\'re interested in is just one question, whether Congress wanted a court to give, in this kind of situation, deference to the agency. And the answer will be, it depends. Chevron is a good rule of thumb, but it isn\\'t a straightjacket.    So what you\\'d look at here is it\\'s the FCC that is in charge of national communications, of which this is part. There is a specific provision, as your colleague points out, that says, \"but don\\'t interfere with the States when they are citing stuff.\" But then there is a limitation to that specific provision, which consists of six or seven parts, all of which maintain a lot of authority in the FCC or rules about what they are not supposed to do. And then, here, it uses the word \"reasonable.\" So where you have a Federal agency with expertise that\\'s in charge of this kind of area and they have rule-making authority, and you have a statute like this, which is a little bit ambiguous, but not too, in respect to the point about whether they do interpretation, you\\'d add up those factors and make a decision',\n",

And Harlan, in Abbott Labs, explains completely and thoroughly what this Court has done in Frozen Food Express, what the Court did in Storer. And on the point you\\'re now making, what he says specifically is the ICC order is right for review, even though it would have no effect until later. Someone decided to bring a particular action. He says that in Storer, the Commission, policy determination is ripe, even though it would not issue a television license that\\'s what the policy said even though no specific application was before the court. So it wouldn\\'t take effect until later. And the same thing is true precisely of the order in Abbott Labs itself. It was a statement of interpreting what the Commission would do, and nothing    Subject to Final Review was going to happen. Nothing happened, unless later on somebody decided to violate it. Much like this. And even if they violated it, nothing would happen, unless the Commission decided to prosecute. So what Justice Ginsburg said was, once this is in effect, okay, now what happens? The person who is subject to it has to take certain steps because of the law. One, spend $, to try to get an exception and fail, or two, do nothing, violate it, and possibly go to prison. Those sound like important legal consequences that flow from an order that, in respect to the Agency, is final, for it has nothing left to do about that interpretation. And B, is perfectly suited for review in the courts. So we have harm flowing from a change in legal relations, we have an agency that has nothing left to do on this particular matter, and we have a court that is perfectly suited to review it. I would say it flows from Abbott Labs, almost QED. So what is your what is your response to that?',\n",

And in this case, we have a whole set, a whole part of the CFR which is devoted this, which goes to varied it\\'s called \"Jurisdictional Determination from Instructional Guidebook.\" The Army Corps of Engineers is brought in. Once they make a determination, it\\'s called the Agency\\'s official view. It\\'s stated it remains in effect for five years, unless conditions change. And you, in your brief, say that the issuance of an approved jurisdictional determination marks the culmination of the distinct process by which the Corps informs a landowner whether the Corps believes that covered waters are present. So that doesn\\'t sound like someone giving informal advice, and there\\'s an appeal process. It sounds like a formal system of answering a question, which question is: Are these lands wetlands, Federal or not?    Subject to Final Review Now, if you give some kind of informal advice, fine.

It might be that the formal is, other things being equal, final Agency action in respect to that matter. It might be that the latter is not.

On the other hand, we\\'re very worried about them tying up some kind of whatever it is, particularly a thing that itself could be used for further advance. And so that the compromise that has been built historically into this area is, of course, if you get a new satisfying process to extract the sap from the plant in the Amazon, patented. Of course, if you get the sap out and you find that you can use it, you manipulate it, you use it, you figure out a way to use it to treat cancer, wonderful, patented. But what you can\\'t patent is the sap itself. Now, in any individual case that might be unfortunate or fortunate. But consider it in the mine run of things. It\\'s important to keep products of nature free of the restrictions that patents there are, so when Captain Ferno goes to the Amazon and discovers new types of plants, saps and medicines, discovers them, although that expedition was expensive, although nobody had found it before, he can\\'t get a patent on the thing itself. He gets a patent on the process, on the use of the thing, but not the thing itself.

It just happens to prevent arbitration. And he says that's absolutely true of this one, that once you get into class actions you will discover you have something that really looks like a court case.

You have methods for enforcing the deposition. You have all kinds of things. He can make a much bigger list than me.

The junior lender lends million, so now he has million. The property ends up being worth a million.

And you subtract that, too, so he gets another days or so, or days credit, and that's it. And that's following the statute, it seems to me, absolutely literally.

In other words, you don't cut the sentence in the first year. You don't begin cut until the second     year has been served, so he has to serve days.

But if you were to apply the last sentence to that first year, the prorating sentence, you wouldn't get . You would get like days, or or something like that. But everybody agrees under the Bureau of Prisons system that it is .

It doesn't make much sense because sometimes they account for percent, but they can't elect anybody, because they all divide on four different people, or maybe they didn't turn out. On the other hand, sometimes if they account for percent, they could elect the candidate of their choice. So it looks as if that percent is pretty arbitrary and we're looking for a better criterion.

Suppose you wouldn't have to go to percent; suppose, for example, you started looking in the percents, and you said, you know, if the black group is going to elect their candidate with percent, or percent even, they're going to need a lot of crossovers, because they may only vote -- you know, only percent may turn out. They     are going to need a lot of crossovers. And the more crossovers you have to have, the harder it is to say that that white group is out there trying to beat them. So there's a kind of natural stopping place. When I worked out the numbers, it seemed that natural stopping place fell around - percent. It sort of fell -- as you said, that the black group -- you insist that the black group had to be twice as many as the white group that crossed over.
